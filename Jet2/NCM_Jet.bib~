Formic acid was observed as a major intermediate of dimethyl ether oxidation at low temperatures. The experimental species-evolution profiles were compared to the predictions of a previously published detailed kinetic mechanism [1]. This mechanism did not predict the formation of formic acid. In the current study we have included chemistry leading to formic acid formation (and oxidation).

The JSR results are particularly valuable as they include concentration profiles of reactants, intermediates, and products pertinent to the oxidation of DME. These data test the kinetic model severely, as it must be able to predict the correct distribution and concentrations of intermediate and final products formed in the oxidation process. Additionally, the shock-tube results are very useful, as they were taken at low temperatures and at high pressures, and thus undergo negative temperature dependence (NTC) behavior. This behavior is characteristic of the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbon fuels, (e.g., the primary reference fuels, n-heptane and iso-octane) under similar conditions. The numerical model consists of 78 chemical species and 336 chemical reactions. The thermodynamic properties of unknown species pertaining to DME oxidation were calculated using THERM.},

In particular, the presence of low-temperature chemical reactivity was detected nonintrusively by using a photomultiplier tube combined with a filter to capture the chemiluminescence of HCHO, which is a characteristic intermediate species formed in low-temperature chemistry. Furthermore, the ignition temperature was determined through high-sensitivity infrared imaging with proper discrimination of the background signal. Experimental results show that the transport-coupled low-temperature, NTC chemical reactivity is enhanced with smaller strain rate, higher air boundary temperature, and is insensitive to the fuel concentration. These findings agree well with those obtained from computation using detailed chemistry, leading to further identification of the controlling chemistry.},

abstract = {The high order conservative finite difference scheme of Morinishi et al. [Y. Morinishi, O.V. Vasilyev, T. Ogi, Fully conservative finite difference scheme in cylindrical coordinates for incompressible flow simulations, J. Comput. Phys. 197 (2004) 686] is extended to simulate variable density flows in complex geometries with cylindrical or cartesian non-uniform meshes. The formulation discretely conserves mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in a periodic domain. In the presence of walls, boundary conditions that ensure primary conservation have been derived, while secondary conservation is shown to remain satisfactory. In the case of cylindrical coordinates, it is desirable to increase the order of accuracy of the convective term in the radial direction, where most gradients are often found. A straightforward centerline treatment is employed, leading to good accuracy as well as satisfactory robustness. A similar strategy is introduced to increase the order of accuracy of the viscous terms. The overall numerical scheme obtained is highly suitable for the simulation of reactive turbulent flows in realistic geometries, for it combines arbitrarily high order of accuracy, discrete conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with consistent boundary conditions. This numerical methodology is used to simulate a series of canonical turbulent flows ranging from isotropic turbulence to a variable density round jet. Both direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) results are presented. It is observed that higher order spatial accuracy can improve significantly the quality of the results. The error to cost ratio is analyzed in details for a few cases. The results suggest that high order schemes can be more computationally efficient than low order schemes.},

This consists of a fuel-rich premixed flame, a fuel-lean premixed flame, and, starting where these flames meet, a diffusion flame. Such formations have been observed experimentally and probably occur as laminar flamelets in turbulent diffusion flames. A low-heat-release model for such flame structures is developed and solutions are obtained in the limit of slowly varying premixed flames. Under these conditions, it is shown that the Triple-Flame propagation speed depends on the transverse mixture fraction gradient and is bounded above by the maximum adiabatic laminar flame speed of the system.},

In this paper we present our results on ignition of nonpremixed, counterflowing jets of 20\% H2 in N2 versus heated air, within a wide range of pressures and flow strain rates. The system was brought to ignition by increasing gradually the temperature of the air stream. Each steady-state situation just prior to ignition was characterized by measuring detailed centerline axial flow velocity and temperature distributions, for ambient pressures between 0.1-6.0 atm and pressure-weighted strain rates between 50-400 sâˆ?. The ignition temperature, defined as the maximum temperature of the air jet just prior to ignition, was found to increase with increasing flow strain rate at all pressures. Furthermore, its sensitivity to strain-rate variations was found to be much higher at elevated and reduced pressures (above âˆ?2 atm and below âˆ?0.5 atm) than it was at atmospheric pressure. Ignition temperatures at constant pressure-weighted strain rates exhibited a â€˜Zâ€?shaped pressure dependence similar to that observed in explosion limits of homogeneous H2-air mixtures, and to the ignition limits identified in earlier numerical and asymptotic analyses. The experimental data was found to be in good agreement with computations using full chemical kinetics and transport properties.},

In the neighborhood of the stagnation point produced in these flames, a chemically reacting boundary layer is established. For a given equivalence ratio, the input flow velocity can be varied and solutions can be determined for increasing values of the strain rate. As the strain rate increases, the flame nears extinction. In the vicinity of the extinction point, however, the Jacobian of the system becomes singular. To avoid computational difficulties, we employ numerical bifurcation techniques to generate the approriate steady-state profiles (both physical and nonphysical). The method is applied to study the extinction behavior of a one-step kinetics model of a premixed hydrogen-air and methane-air flame in a counterflow geometry.},

Species profiles for two methane-air flames with equivalence ratios and cold-gas flow velocities similar to those of the DME flames were also obtained for comparison to the DME results, Mole fractions of C-2 product species were similar in DME and methane flames of similar equivalence ratios. However, the CH2O mole fractions were 5-10 times larger in the DME flames. These experimental profiles are compared to profiles generated in a computer modeling study using the best available DME-air chemical kinetic mechanism. The Appendix presents photographs of DME, methane, and ethane diffusion flames. These results show that, while DME produces soot, its yellow flame luminosity is much smaller than that of an ethane flame at the same fuel volume flow rate, consistent with the low soot emission rate observed when DME is used as a diesel fuel},

It was observed that the propagation speed of tribrachial flame showed appreciable deviations at various jet velocities in high mixture fraction gradient regime. From the similarity solutions, it was demonstrated that the velocity gradient varied significantly during the flame propagation. To examine the effect of velocity gradient, detail structures of tribrachial flames were investigated from OH LIF images and Abel transformed images of flame luminosity. It was revealed that the tribrachial point was located on the slanted surface of the premixed wing, and this slanted angle was correlated with the velocity gradient along the stoichiometric contour. The temperature field was visualized qualitatively by the Rayleigh scattering image. The propagation speed of tribrachial flame was corrected by considering the direction of flame propagation with the slanted angle and effective heat conduction to upstream. The corrected propagation speed of tribrachial flame was correlated well. Thus, the mixture fraction gradient together with the velocity gradient affected the propagation speed.},

abstract = {System response S-curves for a hydrogen-air diffusion flame have been simulated numerically using detailed chemistry and transport. In particular, the globally nonpremixed ignition state has been studied in three distinct ignition regimes at pressures of 0.1, 1, and 10 atm. The role of heat release in providing â€œthermal feedbackâ€?at the ignition turning point is examined in detail for all three regimes. Contrary to classical notions based upon one-step overall chemistry, thermal feedback is shown to play essentiallyno or minimal role in the steady-state solution at the ignition turning pointâ€”either in its character or parametric dependence. In the majority of cases studied, turning point and S-curve behavior are found to exist in the complete absence of heat release, driven solely by â€œkineticâ€?feedback provided by nonlinearities in the coupled chemical kinetics. As a result, the location of the ignition turning point, which depends parametrically upon global variables such as air temperature, strain rate, pressure, and fuel concentration, is essentially governed by the kinetics of gain versus loss of key radicals in the ignition kernel. One cause of this phenomenon is the extremely small size of the radical pool at the ignition turning point, which necessarily limits the degree of localized heat release and temperature perturbation. The small radical pool is also found to decouple the problem such that, on the lower branch and around the ignition turning point, the temperature and possibly major species profiles may be solved independently of the complex chemistry involving the minor species. Furthermore, it is also suggested that when heat release is not significant at the ignition turning point, the transient ignition process (from the turning point to a diffusion flame) must begin with an induction period wherein the radical pool increases via essentially isothermal chemical kinetics before thermal feedback can ensue.},

abstract = {The structure and stabilisation mechanism of partially premixed, laminar, dimethyl ether (DME) flames are investigated using two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). The simulations are performed at a pressure of 40 atmospheres and at oxidiser temperatures of 700, 900, 1100, 1300, and 1500K, while keeping the lift-off length approximately fixed by varying the inlet velocity. At this pressure, DME exhibits two stage ignition below approximately 1100K and a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime from approximately 800â€?100K. The DNS results are investigated by considering the thermochemical structure of the flames and by applying a transport budget analysis to key chemical species. The results show a transition from a lifted flame stabilised by conduction and diffusion-assisted flame propagation to a flame stabilised by autoignition with increasing temperature. At 700K, the flame has a classical tribrachial structure similar to freely propagating edge flames at non-autoignitive conditions. The intermediate temperature cases reveal a complex transition involving multiple heat release pathways upstream of the stabilisation point. At 900K, the flame consists of a main-tribrachial structure and an additional upstream branch due to low temperature chemistry: this is termed a tetrabrachial flame. At 1100 and 1300K, two upstream branches are observed in addition to the main tribrachial structure, one due to low temperature chemistry and the other due to high temperature chemistry, which initiates autoignition and stabilises the flame: these are termed pentabrachial flames. At 1500K, the low temperature upstream branch is suppressed, so there is only one upstream branch due to high temperature chemistry which proceeds to autoignition, this flame has a tetrabrachial structure, but one which is different from that observed in the 900K case.},

For homogeneous mixtures, results show that ignition occurs in two-stages within the NTC temperature regime, with the duration and temperature increment decreasing with increasing initial temperature for the first ignition stage, leading to increased duration of the second ignition stage and thereby the observed NTC-behavior. For the nonpremixed counterflow, results show that a secondary S-curve is developed on the lower branch of the conventional, primary S-curve for sufficiently low strain rates and/or sufficiently high pressures, with its own distinct ignition-extinction turning points. Sensitivity analysis and Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA) show that this secondary S-curve is controlled by the low-temperature NTC-chemistry, with heat release negligible for states on its lower branch and discernable for states on its upper branch and hence assuming the characteristics of a weakly-burning flame. The possible existence of one- and two-staged ignition in the counterflow is observed, and its dependence on the flow strain rate and system pressure are identified. ?? 2011 The Combustion Institute.},

An analysis on the flame response by the perturbation from the tribrachial location shows that the lifted flame is unstable for Sc < 1, confirming the experimental findings of the nonexistence of stationary lifted flames for methane and ethane jets. Appreciable upstream mass diffusion from the nozzle exit for Sc < 0.5 explains the flame behaviour for hydrogen fuel such that a nozzle-attached flame exists even up to jet velocities comparable to the speed of sound. Flow-field measurements using laser Doppler velocimetry reveal that the flow velocity at the flame stabilization location for lifted flames is larger than the laminar burning velocity of the stoichiometric premixture, which confirms the increasing effect on flame speed by the flow redirection for tribachial flames. Also, it is demonstrated that the region between the nozzle exit and the anchoring point of the lifted flames can be treated as a cold jet.},

These experimental data, relevant to low- to moderately-high-temperature ignition chemistry and high-temperature flame chemistry, respectively, were subsequently compared with calculations using two detailed kinetic mechanisms. A chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) was then conducted to identify the dominant ignition chemistry and the role of ethylene addition in facilitating nonpremixed ignition. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of the associated oxidation kinetics was examined by comparing the sizes and constituents of the skeletal mechanisms of the pure fuels and their mixtures, derived using the method of directed relation graph (DRG). The skeletal mechanism was further reduced by time-scale analysis, leading to a 24-species reduced mechanism from the detailed mechanism of USC Mech II, validated within the parameter space of the conducted experiments.},

abstract = {A lifted laminar axisymmetric diffusion flame is stabilized in the downstream region of a diluted methane jet that is surrounded by a lean methane-air co-flow and an outer co-flow of air. The flame shows a distinct triple flame structure in the stabilization region. It is investigated experimentally by PIV for the velocity field, OH-LIPF imaging, C2Hx-LIF imaging, and a 1D-Raman technique for major species concentrations, combined with a Rayleigh technique for temperature. This is complemented by numerical simulations solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in the zero Mach number limit on an adapted mesh, coupled with balance equations for temperature and species. A simplified model for molecular transport properties was used with constant, but non-unity, Lewis numbers for all species. Chemistry is represented by a ten-step reduced mechanism for methane oxidation, which was derived starting from a 61-step elementary mechanism that includes the C1 and C2 chains. The agreement between the measured and the predicted flow field is very satisfactory. Owing to gas expansion, the velocity decreases immediately ahead of the flame and increases strongly at the flame front. Further downstream acceleration due to buoyancy is dominant and is predicted accurately. There is a good agreement between measurements and computations for flame shape and flame length. The measured OH-LIPF image and the computed OH concentrations indicate that OH is concentrated in the vicinity of stoichiometric mixture. The results from a newly developed C2Hx-LIF method are also supported by calculations. While these measurements were only qualitative, the temperature and mole fractions of the major species could be measured quantitatively with the combined Raman-/Rayleigh technique along a line and were found to agree well with the numerical predictions. It is found that the structure is a triple flame and is influenced essentially by two external parameters: heat exchange between the branches and heat loss at the curved flame front near the triple point.},

The measurement system was validated using laminar burning velocities of methane-air flames. A comparison with the previous experimental data shows an excellent agreement and demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the present experimental system. The measured flame speeds of DME-air flames were compared with the previous experimental data and the predictions using the full and reduced mechanisms. At atmospheric pressure, the measured laminar burning velocities of DME-air flames are in reasonable agreement with the previous data from spherical bomb method, but are much lower than both predictions and the experimental data of the PIV based counterflow flame measurements. The laminar burning velocities of DME-air flames at 2, 6, and 10 atm were also measured. It was found that flame speed decreases considerably with the increase of pressure. Moreover, the measured flame speeds are also lower than the predictions at high pressures. In addition, experiments showed that at high pressures the rich DME-air flames are strongly affected by the hydrodynamic and thermal-diffusive instabilities. Markstein lengths and the overall reaction order at different equivalence ratios were extracted from the flame speed data at elevated pressures. Sensitivity analysis showed that reactions involving methyl and formyl radicals play an important role in DME-air flame propagation and suggested that systematic modification of the reactions rates associated with methyl and formyl formations are necessary to reduce the discrepancies between predictions and measurements. ?? 2004 The Combustion Institute.

Heat release increases the flame speed over that of the corresponding planar premixed flame. In agreement with previous analytical work, reductions in the mixture fraction gradient also increase the flame speed. The effects of heat release and mixture fraction gradients on flame speed are not independent, however; heat release modifies the effective mixture fraction gradient in front of the flame.

It is first shown that the first-stage auto-ignition delay time, ??1, possesses a minimum value, ??1,min, with increasing temperature, and that for temperatures below the range corresponding to ??1,min, ??1 is largely insensitive to the equivalence ratio (??) and pressure (p) of the mixture. Furthermore, in this regime the global reaction order was found to be close to unity, hence supporting the notion that the limiting steps in this temperature regime are the RO2 isomerization reactions, which in turn explains the insensitivity of ??1 on ?? and p in this temperature regime. However, when the temperature approaches that of ??1,min, competition of QOOH decomposition and the ?? scission reactions of the alkyl radicals with the low-temperature chemistry chain reactions, as well as the equilibrium shift of the oxygen addition reactions, increases ??1 and consequently results in ??1,min. The corresponding global reaction order also increases, to about two, indicating the progressive importance of the oxygen addition reactions. Extracted values of the global activation energy are also close to those of the controlling reactions in these temperature regimes. Results from the counterflow show the same global kinetic responses by identifying the reciprocal of the counterflow strain rate as the relevant ignition delay time and the temperature of the heated air stream as the homogeneous mixture temperature. It is further found that in the temperature range corresponding to ??1,min, the diminished heat release causes the counterflow to lose its characteristic, non-monotonic S-curve response and consequently distinct, abrupt ignition-extinction transition events. ?? 2013 The Combustion Institute.},

The calculated decomposition rate is significantly different from that utilized in prior work (Fischer et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 713â€?40; Curran et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 741â€?59). DME pyrolysis experiments were performed at 980 K in a variable-pressure flow reactor at a pressure of 10 atm, a considerably higher pressure than previous validation data. Both unimolecular decomposition and radical abstraction are significant in describing DME pyrolysis, and hierarchical methodology was applied to produce a comprehensive high-temperature model for pyrolysis and oxidation that includes the new decomposition parameters and more recent small molecule/radical kinetic and thermochemical data. The high-temperature model shows improved agreement against the new pyrolysis data and the wide range of high-temperature oxidation data modeled in prior work, as well as new low-pressure burner-stabilized species profiles (Cool et al., Proc Combust Inst 2007, 31, 285â€?94) and laminar flame data for DME/methane mixtures (Chen et al., Proc Combust Inst 2007, 31, 1215â€?222). The high-temperature model was combined with low-temperature oxidation chemistry (adopted from Fischer et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 713â€?40), with some modifications to several important reactions. The revised construct shows good agreement against high- as well as low-temperature flow reactor and jet-stirred reactor data, shock tube ignition delays, and laminar flame species as well as flame speed measurements.

abstract = {The ignition temperature of nitrogen-diluted dimethyl ether (DME) by heated air in counterflow was experimentally determined for DME concentration from 5.9\% to 30\%, system pressure from 1.5 to 3.0 atm, and pressure-weighted strain rate from 110 to 170s-1. These experimental data were compared with two mechanisms that were, respectively, available in 1998 and 2003, with the latter being a substantially updated version of the former. The comparison showed that while the 1998-mechanism uniformly over-predicted the ignition temperature, the 2003-mechanism yielded a surprisingly close agreement for all experimental data. Sensitivity analysis for the near-ignition state based on both mechanisms identified the deficiencies of the 1998-mechanism, in particular, the specifics of the low-temperature cool flame chemistry in effecting ignition at higher temperatures, as the fuel stream is being progressively heated from its cold boundary to the high-temperature ignition region around the hot-stream boundary. The 2003-mechanism, consisting of 79 species and 398 elementary reactions, was then systematically simplified by using the directed relation graph method to a skeletal mechanism of 49 species and 251 elementary reactions, which in turn was simplified further by using computational singular perturbation method and quasi-steady-state species assumption to a reduced mechanism consisting of 33 species and 28 lumped reactions. It was demonstrated that both the skeletal and reduced mechanisms mimicked the performance of the detailed mechanism with high accuracy. ?? 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The unsteady flamelet model is applied in numerical simulations of a steady, turbulent, nitrogen-diluted hydrogen-air diffusion flame. An unsteady flamelet is solved interactively with a CFD solver for the turbulent flow and the mixture fraction field. Transient effects occurring in steady jet diffusion flames are discussed in terms of the relevant timescales. It is shown that radiation can be neglected and that the flame structure is hardly influenced by transient effects for the present case. However, for predictions of slow processes, like the formation of NO, unsteady effects have to be considered. The results predicted by the model are in reasonable agreement to experimental data for temperature, major species mass fractions, OH, and NO mole fractions. On the contrary, the use of steady flamelet libraries yields good results for flame structure and even OH concentrations, but NO is overpredicted by an order of magnitude. However, reasonably well-predicted NO concentrations can also be obtained by solving an unsteady flamelet as a postprocessing mode.},

abstract = {A flamelet formulation for non-premixed combustion that allows an exact description of differential diffusion has been developed. The main difference to previous formulations is the definition of a mixture fraction variable, which is not related directly to any combination of the reactive scalars, but defined from the solution of a conservation equation with an arbitrary diffusion coefficient and appropriate boundary conditions. Using this definition flamelet equations with the mixture fraction as the independent coordinate are derived without any assumptions about the Lewis numbers for chemical species. The formulation is shown to be exact if the scalar dissipation rate is prescribed as a function of the mixture fraction. Different approximations of the scalar dissipation rate that had been derived from analytic solutions for special cases are investigated by varying the diffusion coefficient of the mixture fraction transport equation. As examples, counterflow flames of hydrogen and n-heptane, which have much larger and much smaller diffusivities than oxygen and nitrogen, are considered. It is shown that the use of equal thermal and mixture fraction diffusivities yields a sufficiently well-described flame structure and is therefore recommended for the definition of the mixture fraction diffusion coefficient. Finally, the possibility of using constant species Lewis numbers has been examined. It has been found that once an appropriate set of Lewis numbers is determined, good results are achieved over wide ranges of the parameters, such as scalar dissipation rate, pressure, and oxidizer temperature.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of a two-dimensional, nonpremixed, sooting ethylene flame are performed to examine the effects of sootâ€“flame interactions and transport in an unsteady configuration. A 15-step, 19-species (with 10 quasi-steady species) chemical mechanism was used for gas chemistry, with a two-moment, four-step, semiempirical soot model. Flame curvature is shown to result in flames that move, relative to the fluid, either toward or away from rich soot formation regions, resulting in soot being essentially convected into or away from the flame. This relative motion of flame and soot results in a wide spread of soot in the mixture fraction coordinate. In regions where the center of curvature of the flame is in the fuel stream, the flame motion is toward the fuel and soot is located near the flame at high temperature and hence has higher reaction rates and radiative heat fluxes. Sootâ€“flame breakthrough is also observed in these regions. Fluid convection and flame displacement velocity relative to fluid convection are of similar magnitudes while thermophoretic diffusion is 5â€?0 times lower. These results emphasize the importance of both unsteady and multidimensional effects on soot formation and transport in turbulent flames.},
