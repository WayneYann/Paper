abstract = {To determine self-ignition characteristics under conditions relevant to piston engines combustion, n-heptane-air mixtures have been investigated in a high-pressure shock tube without use of the customary heat bath dilution. The initial pressure has been varied between 3.2 and 42 bar and the initial temperature between 660 and 1350 K, while the equivalence ratio covers the region between 0.5 and 3.0. In dependence upon these parameters the histories of pressure and CH-band emissions at 4315 ?? show different ignition behavior. This can be related to different modes of ignition, as 'strong' ignition and 'weak' ignition and in part to two-stage-ignition. The dependence of the ignition delay times upon initial temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio is presented. A comparison with previous work is given.},

On-line extraction sampling in conjunction with FTIR, NDIR (for CO and CO2), and electrochemical (for O2) analyses were performed to quantify species at specific locations along the axis of the turbulent flow reactor. Product species concentrations were correlated against residence time (at constant inlet temperature) and against temperature (at fixed mean residence time) in the reactor. Formic acid was observed as a major intermediate of dimethyl ether oxidation at low temperatures. The experimental species-evolution profiles were compared to the predictions of a previously published detailed kinetic mechanism [1]. This mechanism did not predict the formation of formic acid. In the current study we have included chemistry leading to formic acid formation (and oxidation).

abstract = {A detailed chemical kinetic model has been used to study dimethyl ether (DME) oxidation over a wide range of conditions. Experimental results obtained in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at 1 and 10 atm, 0.2≤ϕ≤2.5, and 800≤T≤1300 K were modeled, in addition to those generated in a shock tube at 13 and 40 bar, ϕ=1.0 and 650≤T≤1300 K. The JSR results are particularly valuable as they include concentration profiles of reactants, intermediates, and products pertinent to the oxidation of DME. These data test the kinetic model severely, as it must be able to predict the correct distribution and concentrations of intermediate and final products formed in the oxidation process. Additionally, the shock-tube results are very useful, as they were taken at low temperatures and at high pressures, and thus undergo negative temperature dependence (NTC) behavior. This behavior is characteristic of the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbon fuels, (e.g., the primary reference fuels, n-heptane and iso-octane) under similar conditions. The numerical model consists of 78 chemical species and 336 chemical reactions. The thermodynamic properties of unknown species pertaining to DME oxidation were calculated using THERM.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A variable pressure, counterflow combustion chamber has been built for the experimental investigation of ignition in a convective-diffusive system. In this paper we present our results on ignition of nonpremixed, counterflowing jets of 20\% H2 in N2 versus heated air, within a wide range of pressures and flow strain rates. The system was brought to ignition by increasing gradually the temperature of the air stream. Each steady-state situation just prior to ignition was characterized by measuring detailed centerline axial flow velocity and temperature distributions, for ambient pressures between 0.1-6.0 atm and pressure-weighted strain rates between 50-400 s−1. The ignition temperature, defined as the maximum temperature of the air jet just prior to ignition, was found to increase with increasing flow strain rate at all pressures. Furthermore, its sensitivity to strain-rate variations was found to be much higher at elevated and reduced pressures (above ∼ 2 atm and below ∼ 0.5 atm) than it was at atmospheric pressure. Ignition temperatures at constant pressure-weighted strain rates exhibited a ‘Z’-shaped pressure dependence similar to that observed in explosion limits of homogeneous H2-air mixtures, and to the ignition limits identified in earlier numerical and asymptotic analyses. The experimental data was found to be in good agreement with computations using full chemical kinetics and transport properties.},

In the neighborhood of the stagnation point produced in these flames, a chemically reacting boundary layer is established. For a given equivalence ratio, the input flow velocity can be varied and solutions can be determined for increasing values of the strain rate. As the strain rate increases, the flame nears extinction. In the vicinity of the extinction point, however, the Jacobian of the system becomes singular. To avoid computational difficulties, we employ numerical bifurcation techniques to generate the approriate steady-state profiles (both physical and nonphysical). The method is applied to study the extinction behavior of a one-step kinetics model of a premixed hydrogen-air and methane-air flame in a counterflow geometry.},

abstract = {Chemical species profiles have been measured at atmospheric pressure for two dimethyl ether (DME)-air flat flames having fuel/air equivalence ratios of 0.67 and 1.49. The samples, obtained with an uncooled quartz probe, were analyzed by either gas chromatography or Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, DME, CO, CO2, O-2, CH2O, and formic acid. a pneumatic probe calibrated at a reference position in the burned gas by a radiation-corrected thermocouple provided temperature profiles for each flame. Species profiles for two methane-air flames with equivalence ratios and cold-gas flow velocities similar to those of the DME flames were also obtained for comparison to the DME results, Mole fractions of C-2 product species were similar in DME and methane flames of similar equivalence ratios. However, the CH2O mole fractions were 5-10 times larger in the DME flames. These experimental profiles are compared to profiles generated in a computer modeling study using the best available DME-air chemical kinetic mechanism. The Appendix presents photographs of DME, methane, and ethane diffusion flames. These results show that, while DME produces soot, its yellow flame luminosity is much smaller than that of an ethane flame at the same fuel volume flow rate, consistent with the low soot emission rate observed when DME is used as a diesel fuel},

abstract = {System response S-curves for a hydrogen-air diffusion flame have been simulated numerically using detailed chemistry and transport. In particular, the globally nonpremixed ignition state has been studied in three distinct ignition regimes at pressures of 0.1, 1, and 10 atm. The role of heat release in providing “thermal feedback” at the ignition turning point is examined in detail for all three regimes. Contrary to classical notions based upon one-step overall chemistry, thermal feedback is shown to play essentiallyno or minimal role in the steady-state solution at the ignition turning point—either in its character or parametric dependence. In the majority of cases studied, turning point and S-curve behavior are found to exist in the complete absence of heat release, driven solely by “kinetic” feedback provided by nonlinearities in the coupled chemical kinetics. As a result, the location of the ignition turning point, which depends parametrically upon global variables such as air temperature, strain rate, pressure, and fuel concentration, is essentially governed by the kinetics of gain versus loss of key radicals in the ignition kernel. One cause of this phenomenon is the extremely small size of the radical pool at the ignition turning point, which necessarily limits the degree of localized heat release and temperature perturbation. The small radical pool is also found to decouple the problem such that, on the lower branch and around the ignition turning point, the temperature and possibly major species profiles may be solved independently of the complex chemistry involving the minor species. Furthermore, it is also suggested that when heat release is not significant at the ignition turning point, the transient ignition process (from the turning point to a diffusion flame) must begin with an induction period wherein the radical pool increases via essentially isothermal chemical kinetics before thermal feedback can ensue.},

For homogeneous mixtures, results show that ignition occurs in two-stages within the NTC temperature regime, with the duration and temperature increment decreasing with increasing initial temperature for the first ignition stage, leading to increased duration of the second ignition stage and thereby the observed NTC-behavior. For the nonpremixed counterflow, results show that a secondary S-curve is developed on the lower branch of the conventional, primary S-curve for sufficiently low strain rates and/or sufficiently high pressures, with its own distinct ignition-extinction turning points. Sensitivity analysis and Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA) show that this secondary S-curve is controlled by the low-temperature NTC-chemistry, with heat release negligible for states on its lower branch and discernable for states on its upper branch and hence assuming the characteristics of a weakly-burning flame. The possible existence of one- and two-staged ignition in the counterflow is observed, and its dependence on the flow strain rate and system pressure are identified. ?? 2011 The Combustion Institute.},

These experimental data, relevant to low- to moderately-high-temperature ignition chemistry and high-temperature flame chemistry, respectively, were subsequently compared with calculations using two detailed kinetic mechanisms. A chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) was then conducted to identify the dominant ignition chemistry and the role of ethylene addition in facilitating nonpremixed ignition. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of the associated oxidation kinetics was examined by comparing the sizes and constituents of the skeletal mechanisms of the pure fuels and their mixtures, derived using the method of directed relation graph (DRG).

The measurement system was validated using laminar burning velocities of methane-air flames. A comparison with the previous experimental data shows an excellent agreement and demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the present experimental system. The measured flame speeds of DME-air flames were compared with the previous experimental data and the predictions using the full and reduced mechanisms. At atmospheric pressure, the measured laminar burning velocities of DME-air flames are in reasonable agreement with the previous data from spherical bomb method, but are much lower than both predictions and the experimental data of the PIV based counterflow flame measurements. The laminar burning velocities of DME-air flames at 2, 6, and 10 atm were also measured. It was found that flame speed decreases considerably with the increase of pressure. Moreover, the measured flame speeds are also lower than the predictions at high pressures. In addition, experiments showed that at high pressures the rich DME-air flames are strongly affected by the hydrodynamic and thermal-diffusive instabilities. Markstein lengths and the overall reaction order at different equivalence ratios were extracted from the flame speed data at elevated pressures. Sensitivity analysis showed that reactions involving methyl and formyl radicals play an important role in DME-air flame propagation and suggested that systematic modification of the reactions rates associated with methyl and formyl formations are necessary to reduce the discrepancies between predictions and measurements. ?? 2004 The Combustion Institute.

abstract = {Using n-heptane as a representative fuel exhibiting NTC (negative temperature coefficient) chemistry, a comprehensive computational and mechanism study was conducted on the role and controlling chemistry of the first-stage ignition delay in the superficially dissimilar systems of the auto-ignition of homogeneous mixtures and the nonpremixed counterflow ignition of fuel versus heated air. It is first shown that the first-stage auto-ignition delay time, ??1, possesses a minimum value, ??1,min, with increasing temperature, and that for temperatures below the range corresponding to ??1,min, ??1 is largely insensitive to the equivalence ratio (??) and pressure (p) of the mixture. Furthermore, in this regime the global reaction order was found to be close to unity, hence supporting the notion that the limiting steps in this temperature regime are the RO2 isomerization reactions, which in turn explains the insensitivity of ??1 on ?? and p in this temperature regime. However, when the temperature approaches that of ??1,min, competition of QOOH decomposition and the ?? scission reactions of the alkyl radicals with the low-temperature chemistry chain reactions, as well as the equilibrium shift of the oxygen addition reactions, increases ??1 and consequently results in ??1,min. The corresponding global reaction order also increases, to about two, indicating the progressive importance of the oxygen addition reactions. Extracted values of the global activation energy are also close to those of the controlling reactions in these temperature regimes. Results from the counterflow show the same global kinetic responses by identifying the reciprocal of the counterflow strain rate as the relevant ignition delay time and the temperature of the heated air stream as the homogeneous mixture temperature. It is further found that in the temperature range corresponding to ??1,min, the diminished heat release causes the counterflow to lose its characteristic, non-monotonic S-curve response and consequently distinct, abrupt ignition-extinction transition events. ?? 2013 The Combustion Institute.},

The calculated decomposition rate is significantly different from that utilized in prior work (Fischer et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 713–740; Curran et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 741–759). DME pyrolysis experiments were performed at 980 K in a variable-pressure flow reactor at a pressure of 10 atm, a considerably higher pressure than previous validation data. Both unimolecular decomposition and radical abstraction are significant in describing DME pyrolysis, and hierarchical methodology was applied to produce a comprehensive high-temperature model for pyrolysis and oxidation that includes the new decomposition parameters and more recent small molecule/radical kinetic and thermochemical data. The high-temperature model shows improved agreement against the new pyrolysis data and the wide range of high-temperature oxidation data modeled in prior work, as well as new low-pressure burner-stabilized species profiles (Cool et al., Proc Combust Inst 2007, 31, 285–294) and laminar flame data for DME/methane mixtures (Chen et al., Proc Combust Inst 2007, 31, 1215–1222). The high-temperature model was combined with low-temperature oxidation chemistry (adopted from Fischer et al., Int J Chem Kinet 2000, 32, 713–740), with some modifications to several important reactions. The revised construct shows good agreement against high- as well as low-temperature flow reactor and jet-stirred reactor data, shock tube ignition delays, and laminar flame species as well as flame speed measurements. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The ignition temperature of nitrogen-diluted dimethyl ether (DME) by heated air in counterflow was experimentally determined for DME concentration from 5.9\% to 30\%, system pressure from 1.5 to 3.0 atm, and pressure-weighted strain rate from 110 to 170s-1. These experimental data were compared with two mechanisms that were, respectively, available in 1998 and 2003, with the latter being a substantially updated version of the former. The comparison showed that while the 1998-mechanism uniformly over-predicted the ignition temperature, the 2003-mechanism yielded a surprisingly close agreement for all experimental data. Sensitivity analysis for the near-ignition state based on both mechanisms identified the deficiencies of the 1998-mechanism, in particular, the specifics of the low-temperature cool flame chemistry in effecting ignition at higher temperatures, as the fuel stream is being progressively heated from its cold boundary to the high-temperature ignition region around the hot-stream boundary. The 2003-mechanism, consisting of 79 species and 398 elementary reactions, was then systematically simplified by using the directed relation graph method to a skeletal mechanism of 49 species and 251 elementary reactions, which in turn was simplified further by using computational singular perturbation method and quasi-steady-state species assumption to a reduced mechanism consisting of 33 species and 28 lumped reactions. It was demonstrated that both the skeletal and reduced mechanisms mimicked the performance of the detailed mechanism with high accuracy. ?? 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.
