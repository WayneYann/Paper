\section*{}

In this work, the sooting limits of nonpremixed $n$-heptane, $n$-butanol, and methyl butanoate flames were determined experimentally in a liquid pool stagnation-flow configuration.  In addition, complementary simulations with detailed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemistry and a detailed soot model were performed and compared with the experimental critical strain rates for the sooting flames.  For all three fuels, the response of soot volume fraction to strain rate, chemical pathways for PAH formation, and the rate-limiting steps were examined to interpret the experimental and computational results. \\ \\
