\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The sooting limits of nonpremixed $n$-heptane, $n$-butanol, and methyl butanoate flames were determined experimentally in a liquid pool stagnation-flow configuration.
  \item Simulations with detailed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon chemistry and a detailed soot model were performed and compared with the experimental critical strain rates for the sooting flames.
  \item For all three fuels, the response of soot volume fraction to strain rate, chemical pathways for PAH formation, and the rate-limiting steps were examined.
  \item Methyl butanote was found significantly less sooting compared to $n$-heptane and $n$-butanol.
  \item The differences in sooting tendencies are due to the fuel breakdown processes to produce soot precursors.
\end{itemize}
